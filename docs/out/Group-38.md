|Video2| 2 | For people starting with 2020 or 2021 projects, 2min video of new functionality, showing a significant delta from old. For everyone else, 2min video of all functionality.| 
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| 2 | evidence in GH|
|Number of commits| 2 | in GH|
|Number of commits: by different people| 2 | in GH|
|Issues reports: there are **many**| 2 | 
|Issues are being closed| 2 | evidence in GH|
|DOI badge: exists| 2 | in GH|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | 2 | in GH|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 2 | 
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 2 | doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 2 | 
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| 2 | 
|Use of version control tools| 2 | 
|Use of style checkers | 2 | config files in GH showing your config|

|Other automated analysis tools| 2 | config files in GH|
|Test cases exist| 2 | dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base|
|Test cases are routinely executed| 2 | E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 2 | 
|Issues are discussed before they are closed| 2 | even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
|Chat channel: exists| 2 | Link or screenshots|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.| 2 | If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 2 | 
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 2 | 
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 2 | 
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 2 | 
|Short release cycles | 2 |  (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
