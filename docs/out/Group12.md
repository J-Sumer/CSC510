|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others, but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| 1 | From GH Insights. Sakshamrzt and Ssign0713 are the only two consistently contributing. |
|Number of commits| 3 | From GH commits. 10+ per person. |
|Number of commits: by different people| 2 | From GH Insights. |
|Issues reports: there are **many**| 0 | There are none |
|Issues are being closed| 0 | N/A |
|DOI badge: exists| 3 | From GH within README.md |
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | 3 | docstrings available within each class and consistently formatted|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 3 | 
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 0 | no examples for code in tests/README.md or in INSTALL.md|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 0 | Unfinished repo, no about information, tags, 'pretty' elements that would grab my attention|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| 3 | N/A for homework| 
|Use of version control tools| 3 | Git utilized| 
|Use of style checkers | 0 | Could not identify any used. |

|Other automated analysis tools| 0 | none identified |
|Test cases exist| 3 | Over 10 tests in hw2/tests/unit to meet over 79% code coverage|
|Test cases are routinely executed| 3 | Tests running automatically, beginning with main.yml|

|Issues are discussed before they are closed| 0 | No issues available in Repo |
|Chat channel: exists| 0 | No chat channel available |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.| 0 | No issues opened. |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 2 | This is difficult to identify, but it seemed like people had access. |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 2 | 2 team members updated repo. This seems to be more because they were the main contributors and not because of lack of access.|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 0 | N/A | 
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 2 |
